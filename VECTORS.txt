1. Compromised Administrative Accounts

	•	Phishing: Targeted phishing attacks can trick administrators into revealing their credentials, leading to unauthorized access.
	•	Password Spray Attacks: Attackers use commonly used passwords across a large number of accounts to identify weakly protected administrator accounts.
	•	Credential Stuffing: Using credentials obtained from breaches in other services to attempt to log in to Microsoft 365 accounts.

2. Malicious Application Consents (OAuth Token Theft)

	•	Consent Phishing: Attackers create malicious apps and trick users (including admins) into granting excessive permissions, which can be used to perform privileged actions.
	•	Token Replay: Capturing OAuth tokens to impersonate a user or escalate privileges by accessing APIs with the token.

3. Misconfigured Privileged Access Management (PAM)

	•	Over-permissioned Accounts: Accounts with more privileges than necessary can be exploited if compromised.
	•	Misconfigured Access Policies: Incorrectly configured PAM policies or lack of enforcement can allow unauthorized privilege escalation.

4. Guest User Permissions

	•	Over-permissioned Guest Users: External users (guests) with excessive permissions can be used as a stepping stone for privilege escalation.

5. Exploiting Legacy Authentication Protocols

	•	Older Protocols: Legacy protocols like SMTP, IMAP, POP3 may not support modern authentication, making it easier to bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA) and gain privileged access.

6. Vulnerabilities in Azure AD Conditional Access Policies

	•	Weak or Misconfigured Policies: Incorrectly implemented Conditional Access policies can be exploited to bypass MFA or other security controls, leading to privilege escalation.

7. Abuse of Delegated Permissions

	•	App Permissions Misuse: Applications granted delegated permissions by users or administrators can be abused to act on behalf of users with elevated privileges.

8. Weak MFA or MFA Fatigue Attacks

	•	Poorly Implemented MFA: If MFA is not enforced for all users, or if weak MFA methods are used, attackers can bypass this security measure.
	•	MFA Fatigue: Repeated MFA requests can lead users to approve fraudulent authentication attempts.

9. Exploitation of Service Principal or Managed Identity Misconfigurations

	•	Over-permissioned Service Principals: Service principals with excessive permissions can be compromised to escalate privileges.
	•	Managed Identity Misconfigurations: Poorly configured managed identities in Azure services can be exploited to gain elevated access.

10. Abuse of Admin Consent Workflows

	•	Admin Consent Grants: Exploiting the admin consent process to grant malicious applications broad access within the tenant.

11. Data Leaks Leading to Credential Exposure

	•	Logs and Data Storage: Logs, email attachments, or documents stored insecurely in SharePoint, OneDrive, or other services may contain sensitive credentials or information that can be leveraged for privilege escalation.

12. Insider Threats

	•	Malicious Insiders: Employees with legitimate access may escalate privileges through social engineering or exploiting their access for unauthorized purposes.

13. Abuse of Azure AD Roles and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

	•	Role Elevation: Users with the ability to assign roles may escalate their own privileges or the privileges of others within Azure AD or Microsoft 365.
	•	Role Assignment Exploits: Misconfigured role assignments can allow users to gain higher privileges than intended.

14. Inactive or Unmonitored Accounts

	•	Dormant Accounts: Accounts that are no longer actively used but retain administrative privileges can be a vector for privilege escalation if compromised.

15. Abuse of Conditional Access Exceptions

	•	Bypass Using Trusted Locations: Conditional Access policies might be bypassed if the attacker’s IP falls within a trusted range.
	•	Device Compliance Policies: Exploiting poorly configured device compliance policies to access resources that should require more stringent checks.

Mitigating these risks involves implementing a robust security framework, including enforcing MFA, regularly auditing permissions, using Privileged Identity Management (PIM), and monitoring for suspicious activities.
